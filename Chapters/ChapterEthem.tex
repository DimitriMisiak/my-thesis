Here is a magnificient chapter about beautiful calculation concerning the modelization of the thermal signal in our bolometers. Too bad python codes cannot be dumped in pdf format, because I would have done it just to boast about it.
Also can help you understand what parameters affect our bolometers, and what should be done to obtain the Roll's Royce of the Germanium Bolometers (0g mass obviously but no).
Bonus: watch me fail to explain the phonon thermalization in germanium crystal. Actually, no one can i think.
