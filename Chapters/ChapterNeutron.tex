\section{Quick presentattion}

Hey, there !
Just to let you know that I did the analysis for the neutron measurements. And I also took the data. Yep, with my very own detector called RED80. Its electrodes are a bit of a mess, but I like it very much cause it gave us some very nice results, with nice discrimination and the possibility to see the neutron band.
