Let me tell you about my work with an electrostatic simulation software called COMSOL.
That was quite nice. Just designing the detector and the aluminium electrodes with a beautiful and efficient interface.
Thanks to that, I could simulate a lot of configuration and geometry to probe for the finest results out there.
Finest meaning a lot of fiducial volume, good charge collection, and low electric capacity.
A usual impossible to solve problem which lead to a lot of trade-off in itself, without adding the issues about the heat channel.
But hey, I could obtain some nice plots and tables, check them out.
