abstract = "A gamma and an x-ray spectrometer, 4πβ—γ-coincidence equipment, liquid-scintillation counting (LSC) equipment and a calibrated ionization chamber (IC) have been used to determine the decay scheme parameters of 68Ga and the specific activity of a 68Ge/68Ga solution. The transition probability of the positron branch and the EC branch to the ground state of 68Zn, b1 and e1, the corresponding branches to the 1077 keV level of 68Zn, b2 and e2, the total emission probability of annihilation radiation from the 68Ga decay, pann, and the gamma-ray emission probabilities of the quanta corresponding to the 1077 keV transition (p1077) and to some weak transitions were redetermined. The results are b1 = 0.8785 ± 0.0012, e1 = 0.0892 ± 0.0012, b2 = 0.0129 ± 0.004, e2 = 0.0193 ± 0.0004, pann = 1.7829 ± 0.0022, p1077 = 0.0322 ± 0.0003. The specific activity of a 68Ge/68Ga solution was determined with a relative uncertainty of 1% (1σ) using 4πβ—γ coincidence, LSC and IC measurements. A half-life of T12 = (270.99 ± 0.19) d for 68Ge was obtained by measurements with an ionization chamber."
