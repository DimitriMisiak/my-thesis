- NTD not a part of the simulation.
While having an expected strong influence on the electric field lines below it, the GeNTD is not a part of the simulation.
It would induce overly complexity in simulation due to none rotationnal symmetrix geometry and unfixed electric potential.
- Teflon calmps not part of simulation
Considering their small volume and with the relative dielectric constant of the material $\epsilon_r = 2.1$ being close to the unity, these Teflon clamps are not taken into account in the simulation.
